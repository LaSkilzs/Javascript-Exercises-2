#### Changing Header -- (Intermediate)

3. A changing text header (cycle through marketing-style slogans, e.g. "CoolService is loved by **\_\_\_**" (freelancers / go-getters / artists / bosses / athletes etc.)).

#### Tabbed Content -- (Intermediate)

4. Tabbed content (click to change view)

6. Doing something on window resize, or scroll, not sure what

#### Carousel -- (Advanced)

7. A scrolling carousel (automatically cycle through images)

#### Local Storage -- (Advanced)

8. To follow up on dark theme idea, using localstorage would be an advanced use case to avoid losing state on refresh; probably that's too much for this group tho.(would be esp. cool with a transition prop). Oh! Dark theme? That works
